# Moon Light Wedding Hall – Reservation System  
CPIT-252 – System Analysis and Design  
King Abdulaziz University

This project presents the complete analysis and design of a reservation system for **Moon Light Wedding Hall** in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.  
The system was analyzed, modeled, and partially prototyped using Java, Figma, and Draw.io as part of the CPIT-252 course requirements.

The objective of the system is to streamline the reservation process, provide clear service information, and support management tasks such as tracking events and customer details.

## Project Overview

The project delivers a full system analysis and design for a wedding hall reservation platform.  
It includes documentation of requirements, use cases, system diagrams, user interfaces, and a Java-based conceptual implementation.  
The work covers:

- Requirement identification  
- System analysis  
- Functional and non-functional requirements  
- UML modeling  
- User interface design  
- Java-based implementation for main functions

## Features (Proposed System)

### Customer Features
- View available services and hall information  
- Register and log in  
- Choose packages  
- Select an available event date  
- Submit a reservation request  
- Receive reminder notifications before their event  
- View visiting hours  

### Management Features
- View and manage reservation requests  
- Access customer information  
- Display upcoming events  
- Track wedding-day preparations  
- Review customer feedback

## Problems Addressed

The manual reservation process causes:  
- Lack of direct access to information  
- Unclear availability schedules  
- Need to visit the hall physically  
- Miscommunication regarding event preparation  

The proposed system addresses these issues by providing:  
- A structured reservation workflow  
- Clear communication of services  
- Organized scheduling information  
- Efficient customer–management interaction

## Tools and Technologies

### Development  
- **Java** (main programming language used during system modeling)

### Design & Modeling  
- **Figma** – UI design and layout  
- **Draw.io** – UML diagrams, DFDs, and workflow charts  

### Documentation  
- Structured according to CPIT-252 course guidelines

## System Documentation

The project includes full system models created using Draw.io:

- Use Case Diagram  
- Use Case Scenarios  
- Activity Diagram  
- Data Flow Diagram (Context, Level-0, Level-1, Level-2)  
- Sequence Diagram  
- Class Diagram  
- State Diagram  

UI mockups and interface concepts were designed using Figma.

## Notes

This project was developed for academic purposes under the CPIT-252 course at King Abdulaziz University.  
It focuses on **analysis, design, modeling, and user interface development** rather than a full software implementation.
